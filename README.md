# Data Cleaner
Data cleaner is a simple application for quick data cleaning with Graphical User Interface.
Users allowed to insert their CSV file into a program, and choose how they want to deal with _dirty data_.
Some functionality are: 

- Removing duplicates; Removing NaN values; 

- Filling NaN with 0; 

- Cleaning special characters such as %$?! and other.


This pet project was created to explore python GUI library **CustomTkinter** which is an improved version of classic Tkinter.
It also brings some minor hands-on practice with **data manipulation** in User Interface Applications.
